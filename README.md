# Alt School GitHub Project

This project is the second-semester exam project from Alt School, a React-based application that consumes the GitHub API to display repositories and their details.

## Features

- 📋 **Repository Listing:** Displays repositories fetched from the GitHub API.
- 🔄 **Pagination:** Utilizes React Paginate for pagination, displaying 6 repositories per page.
- 📡 **Data Fetching:** Uses React Query for efficient data fetching.
- 🛣️ **Dynamic Routing:** React Router handles routing, enabling users to view more details about each repository by clicking the "More Details" button.
- 🎨 **UI Components:** Utilizes Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS for UI components and styling.
- 🔍 **SEO:** Implements React Helmet Async for search engine optimization.
- 🚨 **Error Handling:** Utilizes React Error Boundary for error handling.
- 🎉 **Iconography:** Utilizes React Icons for icons used throughout the application.
- 💼 **Environment Variables:** Implements dotenv to handle environment variables and sensitive data.

PS: Users are allowed to create and delete repositories within the application, but only repositories created within the app itself.
